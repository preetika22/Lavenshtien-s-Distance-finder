# Lavenshtien-s-Distance-finder
Its a python app that shows the dynamic programing implementation of Lavenshtien's distance finder problem.
Levenshtein’s distance finder is an algorithm that takes two strings and compares the 
difference between the two sequences. The Levenshtein distance is a number that tells 
you how different two strings are. The higher the number, the more different the two 
strings are.It is a very popular problem in the design and analysis of algorithms. It is 
also called an edit distance problem. There are two ways to solve this problem one is 
by recursion method and the other is by dynamic programming method. In this project, 
the solution implemented is using the dynamic programming method. Levenshtein’s 
distance is the minimum number of single-character edits that are required to change 
one string to another. Three operations can be done to accomplish the objective, 
insertion, deletion, and replacement.
